## About

This repo is a demo application for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) based on the iOS stock calculator. 
This project targets iOS, but also works on the web. It should work fine on Android but is untested on that platform.

This project makes use of [Tailwinds](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling via the 
[tailwind-rn](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn) package.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. From the project root run `npm install`.

### To run the web version

1. `npm run dev:tailwind`
2. `npm run web`.

## Expo

This project makes use of [Expo](https://expo.dev/) which makes it easy to send to your mobile device. But first you
need to go setup an Expo account and create a new project. It will provide further details from there.
